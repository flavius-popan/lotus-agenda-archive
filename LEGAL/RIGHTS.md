- Screenshots or diagrams created by contributors.

What this repository WILL NOT host
- Installers, disk images, patches, key files, or any binaries from Lotus/IBM/HCL or other third parties, unless a written redistribution grant is provided and added to /LEGAL as evidence.
- Scans or full copies of commercial manuals or books.
- Keys, serials, cracks, or instructions that bypass access controls.
