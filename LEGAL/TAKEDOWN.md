# LEGAL/TAKEDOWN.md

Options to report an issue with this repository

1) Open a public “Takedown request” issue using the repository’s Issue Form. Provide:
   - The exact path and commit hash or release tag of the material.
   - The rights you claim (copyright, trademark, or both) and evidence of ownership or authorization.
   - A statement of good-faith belief that the use is not authorized.
   - The action you seek.

   Note: Issues are public. Do not include sensitive information.

2) Prefer a non-public channel: use GitHub’s official reporting portals:
   - DMCA takedown: https://github.com/contact/dmca
   - Report abuse/trademark: https://github.com/contact/report-abuse

Process
- The maintainer will acknowledge and typically remove or restrict the identified material while evaluating the claim.
- If removal occurs, a brief public note may be added to the commit or PR history describing the action.
- If you withdraw a claim, reply in the same channel so material can be restored if appropriate.

Counter notice
- If you believe a removal was in error, reply in the issue or via the same GitHub portal with supporting documentation.
